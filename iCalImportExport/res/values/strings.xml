		Version 1.0:\nSupporting simple iCal import and export. Attendees are not
		supported.
		\n\nVersion 1.1:\nAssociate program with iCal files. Working in web browser. In
		Froyo also working with any type of file browser.
		\n\nVersion
		1.2:\nTimezone of an event will be changed according to your local
		android timezone. I am not sure if that works, timezones are very
		confusing.
		\n\nVersion 1.3:\nSaves the last URL
		\n\nVersion
		1.4:\nReleased under GPL v3, source available under:
		http://code.google.com/p/ical-import-export/
		\nA life without google:
		If you have no calendars installed, a local calendar can be created.
		But there has to be an existing account (yahoo, or something else)
		\n\nVersion 1.5:\nBasic Http authentication and Ftp authentication via
		input fields. Small bugfix regarding dummy calendar. Insert manual
		alarm, no VAlarm support.</string>
